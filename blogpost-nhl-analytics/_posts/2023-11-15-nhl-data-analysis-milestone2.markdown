## Introduction


The first milestone gave us some experience with data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and creating visualizations. Now, we’ll get our hands dirty with feature engineering, feature selection, and statistical modelling. We will continue to build on the play-by-play data acquired from the NHL stats API, and tackle the problem of predicting the probability that a shot is a goal. We will experiment with a number of different models and features, and produce some visualizations to gauge the effectiveness of our model. We will be using comet.ml to keep track of our experiments with our group. 


### NHL Background: Expected Goals (xG)

A common question when evaluating sports is “how well did a team play?”, or “how well did a particular player perform?”. To answer such questions, we need some sort of metric or statistic that captures the quality of a team/player’s performance. An obvious metric could be to consider the number of goals or points, but the problem is that goals are rare and ‘noisy’ events, which do not account for other factors such as goalie performance. Shots are another option, but there is no notion of the quality of the shot; i.e. was it from a high-danger area, or was it taken far away from the net? 

As a result, simply looking at an aggregate count of shots or goals could be misleading. In an attempt to work past these issues, analysts have turned to statistical modelling techniques to append the notion of “shot quality” to each shot taken. Expected Goals (xG) estimates the quality of a shot by calculating the likelihood that this shot would have resulted in a goal, based on a variety of factors (features) such as position, shot type, prior events, etc. This attempts to model how experienced viewers watching a game can reasonably gauge how good the quality of a shot is, based on a variety of factors such as the state of the play, how close the shot was taken, etc. 

From the perspective of data science, we can intuitively model this as a binary classification task, where each shot has a label indicating whether or not it resulted in a goal. Each shot can have a variety of features ranging from simple ones such as distance and angle from the net, to more complicated ones such as game state, previous events, shot types, etc. It is important to note that while a classifier outputs a binary label [0, 1] to indicate whether or not a shot is predicted to be a goal, this is actually not very useful to us. We’re more interested in the raw probabilities that the classifier produces, which (we hope) is an appropriate proxy for the “shot quality”. Analysts can then aggregate shots weighed by the shot quality in an attempt to gauge team or individual performance (though this is not in the scope of this milestone). Furthermore, a shot that is assigned a high likelihood yet did not result in a goal (or vice-versa) may not actually be misclassified. This may be a bit counter intuitive, but remember we are trying to estimate the shot quality in an attempt to estimate the overall number of high quality scoring chances.

## 2. Feature Engineering I

### 2.1 Question 1

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/hist_shot_count_by_distance.png" caption="Histogram of the Shot Count by Distance" %}

We observe that there are much more shots taken from a closer distance to the net than from a further distance. In fact, nearly 80% of the shots are taken inside the offensive zone (less than 65 feet from the net) and that’s where almost all of the goals are scored. We can barely see the goals count at greater distances (although present), and these goals usually happen when there’s an empty net.

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/hist_shot_count_by_angle.png" caption="Histogram of the Shot Count by Shooting Angle" %}

We decided to keep negative values for the angles because it shows from which side the shot was taken because we believe this could be useful if we wanted to predict the probability of a player scoring a goal depending on his location (especially considering if he is lefty or righty). To be clear, the angle is determined by the relative position to the goal line, so an angle of 90 degrees means the player was facing the net. We can observe that the greater the shooting angle, the more there are shots taken and goals scored. In fact, most of the goals were scored at an angle between 75 and 90 (and -75 to -90) degrees from the goal line. This is normal because that’s where the goaltender can cover the net the least, in comparison to a shot that doesn’t have a good angle. We can also observe that there’s an unusually high goal rate for very small angles (between 0 and 10). This could be explained by the puck being almost in the net and a player just tapping it in (could be confirmed if the distance for these shots are taken in account) or simply luck however the amount is too high for such deduction.

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/2D_hist_distance_vs_angle.png" caption="2D Histogram of the Distance vs the Shooting Angle" %}

This graph allows us to see the shot distance and the shooting angle in one same graph instead of 2 separate ones. We can observe the same things we stated previously: the greater the distance, the less shots are taken and the less goals are scored; and the greater the shooting angle, the more the shots are taken and goals are scored. The “anomaly” with the small shooting angle is still visible.


### 2.2 Question 2

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/goal_rate_vs_distance.png" caption="Goal Rate vs Distance" %}

The goal rate increases as the distance is smaller with the highest goal rate (between 70-80%) being when the shot is within 10 feet of the net. We can also observe an increase of the goal rate starting from a distance of around 90 feet and more (so from the other side of the rink). As mentioned previously, this can be explained by the fact that teams pull out their goaltender at the end to attempt to tie the game if they’re losing. Usually, players will not shoot from their defensive zone but in these situations, they will attempt from a big distance and often succeed because no one is tending the net, hence the increase in the goal rate.

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/goal_rate_vs_angle.png" caption="Goal Rate vs Shooting Angle" %}

The goal rate increases as the shooting angle gets better (bigger). The highest goal rate can be seen for shots taken at an angle between 75 and 90 (and -75 to -90) degrees from the goal line. This is normal because that’s where the goaltender can cover the net the least, in comparison to a shot that doesn’t have a good angle. As mentioned before, we can observe that there’s an unusual spike for the goal rate for very small angles (between 0 and 10).

### 2.3 Question 3

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/hist_goal_distance_empty_nets.png" caption="Histogram of Goals by Distance (Empty Net vs Non-Empty Net)" %}

We can see that most of the goals scored are in fact non-empty net goals. Once again, most of the goals are scored within the offensive zone (less than 65 feet from the net). We can also see that most of the empty net goals are actually scored within 100 feet of the net. Players will attempt shots at an empty net at greater distances since there isn’t a goaltender.


## 3. Baseline Models

### 3.1 Question 1

By using a basic logistic regression model, we observed an accuracy of 0.91. However, upon deeper data exploration, we identified a significant class imbalance issue within the dataset as shown in the confusion matrix below. The number of data instances with an "isGoal" value of 0 outnumbers those with an "isGoal" value of 1 by approximately a factor of nine to ten. This imbalance raises concerns about the potential for model overfitting, where the model might tend to predict all instances as 0 to achieve a high accuracy. Therefore, even though the accuracy appears high, the model's performance is not good.

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/confusion_matrix_lr.png" caption="Confusion Matrix for logistic regression model" %}


To address this imbalance, we should consider data resampling techniques or utilize stratified k-fold cross-validation to rebalance the dataset. Furthermore, it's essential to note that accuracy alone is an insufficient metric for evaluating model performance. Alternative evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, the confusion matrix, ROC curve, AUC (Area Under the Curve), and others, should be taken into account to get a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.

After the resampling techniques, the confusion matrix becomes like this

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/confusion_matrix_lr_resampled.png" caption="Confusion Matrix after resample for logistic regression model" %}

For logistic regression models as baseline models, we tried just the basic logistic regression classifier to fit the data. Also we applied the basic data preprocessing like removing duplicates and nan values from the training, validation sets. Here we used evaluation metrics like training set accuracy, validation set accuracy, f1 score, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the AUC metric of the ROC Curve, the goal rate as a function of the shot probability, the cumulative proportion of goals, and model percentile, and the calibration curve to compare with other models’ performances.

### 3.2-3.3 Question 2 & 3

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/ROC_curve_3lr.png" caption="Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the AUC metric of the ROC Curve" %}

As we can see here, the 4 models are compared together. For the ROC curve, the random classifier gives us an expected diagonal in ROC curve. If we keep the angle as the only feature, it performs more or less like the random classifier. Second, from the goal rate figure, the model with the distance performs better than the random classifier. The feature “distance to goal” is necessary feature to perform well. If we combine the two feature “distance to goal” and “angle” together, it’s a little bit better than having only the “distance to goal” feature, but pretty much the same with the same AUC, which means that the model doesn't learn much from the feature "angle". The first figure with the ROC curves and the AUC metric of the ROC curve is the most useful one to evaluate different models in this case.

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/goal_rate_3lr.png" caption="The goal rate as a function of the shot probability" %}

As for the goal rate plot, we can see that the logistic regression models perform better than random classifier for predicting the shot probability. As the conclusion from the ROC curve, the model with two features perform slightly better than just "distance" feature, the model with only "distance" doesn't perform well because the curve is very contant-like like the random classifier.

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/cumulative_3lr.png" caption="the cumulative proportion of goals, and model percentile" %}

As for the cumulative plot, it shows that shots with higher predicted probabilities get a significantly larger share of the total goals scored, in contrast to shots with lower probabilities. We got the same conclusion as the two previous figures, the models trained on either distance or angle outperform a random baseline, the model with both features consistently outperforms them for predicting the likelihood of a shot resulting in a goal.

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/reliability_curve_3lr.png" caption="the calibration curve" %}

As for the calibration plot, the model trained on both features gets calibration values closest to those of the ideally calibrated model. Same conclusion as before, it is the most favorable one among these 4 classifers. However, that the curve does not extend beyond 0.6, underscoring that the predicted probabilities from our models remain below 0.6%, therefore, we lack strong confidence in the predictions made by our models.

## 4. Feature Engineering II

For this part, we have the following features (some extracted, some created):

   - ShotType: categorical feature of the different shot types (wrist shot, slap shot, tip-in, etc)
   - Period: indicates which period of the game it is, numerical value from 1 to 7 ( 4,5,6,7 are OTs)
   - GameTime: total number of seconds elapsed in the game
   - XCoord: coordinate of the event on the x axis
   - YCoord: coordinate of the event on the y axis
   - isEmptyNet: 0 if the net is not empty, 1 if it is empty
   - isGoal: 0 if the event is not a goal, 1 if it is
   - DistanceToGoal: distance (in feet) between the shot and the net, Nan if it isn’t a shot
   - ShootingAngle: angle to the net of the shot, Nan if it isn’t a shot
   - LastEvent: categorical feature of the different types of event preceding the current one (shot, hit, faceoff, etc)
   - LastEvent_XCoord: coordinate of the last event on the x axis
   - LastEvent_YCoord: coordinate of the last event on the y axis
   - TimeLastEvent: seconds passed since the last event
   - DistanceLastEvent: distance between the current event and the last event
   - Rebound: True if the last event was also a shot, otherwise False
   - AngleChange: angle to the net of the shot if the shot is a rebound, otherwise 0
   - Speed: defined as the distance from the previous event, divided by the time since the previous event


Here's an image to illustrate better the "Speed" and "AngleChange" features:

## 5. Advanced Models

### 5.1 Question 1

The training data has been split into training and validation data in a 1 to 4 ratio. A seed number for the split has been set at the beginning to keep consistency across the XGBoost model. We are not adding any extra hyperparameters at this time (no ratio adjustment for imbalance data etc.). 

The "basic" XGBoost model is doing just a bit better than logistic regression (71% accuracy compare to about 68%). (We did not overlayed the logistic regression curve since it's in a different file.)

### 5.2 Question 2

First, Defining a dictionary for Hyperparameter tuning and using grid search to do cross-validations. From Grid search CV, we could select the 'best' Hyperparameters and used that for later models
For Hyperparameter choices, there are many choices of hyperparameter for tuning, but to save computing time and due to the limit for computing power, we selected 3: "gamma", "max_depth", and "n_estimators".
1. We selected "max_depth" because it's a tree specific hyperparameter. We would like to have deeper tree to capture more complex patter, but also we want to avoid overfitting, so we think this is an important hyperparameter.
2. "gamma" is to control complexity and verify regularization of our model.
3. "n_estimator" controls the number of trees in the mode, we chose this Hyperparameter to limit overfitting
We have also added theweight variable ("scale_pos_weight") to adjust for imbalanced dataset
After tuning, our model accuracy improved dramatically. (71% to 99%)

### 5.3 Question 3

Since our model has a very high accuracy already, we decide to limit the number of features we used to predict. We carried out this process by using the feature importance function from XGBoost, then validate it using SHAP.
We have picked out the top 6 features and still achieving quite high accuracy but substantially lowering the computing time (gridsearchCV computing time from 10min to less than 5 mins).

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/SHAP.png" caption="SHAP for feature selection" %}

We used SHAP Explainer to try validating feature importance for all entrys. We can see that the top features are 'TimeLastEvent', 'DistanceLastEvent', 'isEmptyNet' and how they are contributing to the prediction.

## 6. Give it your best shot!

Now let's try to come up with the best model we can for predicting expected goals! In this section, we will try several different models, some feature selection methods and hyperparameter tuning.

### Feature selection

For feature selection, we have carried out random forest classifier and correlation matrix:
1. Random Rorest Classifier is one of the commonly used tool for feature selection due to their ability to provide feature importances. Here are a few reasons why we chose Random Rorest Classifier:
   - It provides feature importance score for easy computable and interpretable references for feature selection.
   - Also since the accuracy of our model is very high, we are afraid of overfitting, so we chose this one
   - It could also captures feature interaction and correlations between features

2. For correlation matrix, we did this one mostly to have a general and global view of interactions between features, which substantiate our choices from Random Rorest Classifier. If features are highly correlated to 'isGoal' column ( absolute value > 0.7), we should remove them. This is to remove or reduce the possibility that the model looks at those columns only as a 'cheatsheet' for prediction.
As we see in the correlation matrix, no features has a high correlation with 'isGoal' column, negative or positive, which confirms that our feature selection and engineering is doing a decent job.

<!-- {% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/feature_selection.png" caption="Feature Selection" %} -->

[Correlation Matrix]({% link shotMaps/corr_matrix.html %}){:target="_blank"}

### Decision trees

Comet links for decision tree and random forest models:
   - [decision tree](https://www.comet.com/nhl-analytics-milestone-2/decision-tree)
   - [random forest](https://www.comet.com/nhl-analytics-milestone-2/random-forest)

For Decision trees models, we tried the decision tree classifier and random forest classifier to fit the data. We also applied the two different feature selections methods. Then we applied the feature selection methods in the previous part to both of the classifiers. Here we used evaluation metrics like training set accuracy, validation set accuracy, f1 score, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the AUC metric of the ROC
Curve, the goal rate as a function of the shot probability, the cumulative proportion of goals, and model percentile, and the calibration curve to compare with other models’ performances. The results are already good even without any hyperparameter tuning. Firstly, from the ROC curves, all 4 models perform pretty well. And the f1 score, train and test accuracy are also high. According to the calibration curve, the models tend to over-predict the true probability. Lastly, the curve for the decision tree model with the first feature selection method performs better and closer to the reference line than any model.

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/reliability_curve_dt.png" caption="the calibration curve" %}


### Neural Networks

We wanted to try a different type of model so we implemented a neural network. This was done using the keras library.

We shuffled the data in order to not have any order dependency issue. We also split the dataset into a training set, validation set and test set to follow better the performance of the model. Since we had an unbalanced dataset, we used the SMOTE method to create synthetic instances to have the same number of instances classified as goal and not goal.

In terms of preprocessing, we encoded the categorical variables, dropped, the rows with Nans, removed the GameID column, and scaled the columns that made sense to scale (so not the ‘Rebound’ column for instance because it has only 2 values possible, 0 and 1).

#### I. First attempt

At first, we created the neural network with 1 hidden layer (activation function: relu; loss function: binary cross-entropy) containing 32 neurons and trained it on all the features we had from feature engineering 2. It was trained on 100 epochs with the “adam” optimizer and with early stopping. It trains on 50 epochs with an early stopping that checks if the model hasn't improved for the last 10 epochs (with a minimum of 10 epochs done already) and keeps the wiehgts of the best model. We obtained an accuracy of around 99% on the validation set and the test set. The area under the ROC curve was 0.999. However, we can see that on the validation set, the accuracy is oscillating. We figured we would need to optimize the model more. Also, we were worried about overfitting the model with such high accuracies. Here are some graphs to illustrate the first attempt:

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/more_metrics_100it.png" caption="More Metrics to Visualize" %}



#### II. Hyperparameter optimization

After reading some articles, we have come to the conclusion that a SGD optimizer would be more suited for our task. We now had to determine which value to give to the learning rate. We also wanted to test out different numbers of neurons for our layer (we started with only one hidden layer so that the model can be less complex, if it works it’s better) and we also tested with 2 hidden layers.

   1. Learning rate

      We trained and tested the model with these values for the learning rate: 0.00001; 0.0001; 0.001; 0.01; 0.1; 0.2; 0.3. 

      We got satisfying results with these values: 0.00001; 0.0001; 0.001; 0.01. However, the other ones gave horrible results, the accuracy was around 50% on the validation and test set. The best result was achieved with a learning rate of 0.0001 (accuracy of around 98%).

   2. Number of Neurons for 1 hidden layer

      We trained and tested the model with these values for the number of neurons: 4; 8; 16; 32. They all had similar results however, having 16 neurons in the hidden layer was slightly better than the others.

   3. 2nd hidden layer

      We tried the same thing for the second layer and there weren’t any significant differences. We decided to keep only one hidden layer so that our model is less complex and has less chance of overfitting.



#### III. Feature Selection

We have done several feature selection methods and trained our model on the selected ones:

- Random Forest Classifier

   With this method, we kept the following features (the weights were shown in the previously when we discussed about the feature selection methods we did):
   
   - TimeLastEvent
   - Speed
   - DistanceLastEvent
   - LastEvent_XCoord
   - LastEvent_YCoord
   - LastEvent
   - DistanceToGoal
   - XCoord
   - GameTime
   - Period
   
   Here were our results: accuracy of 97.78% on the test set (obtained from the training set as mentioned above).

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/model_accuracy_rfc_ft.png" caption="" %}

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/model_loss_rfc_ft.png" caption="" %}

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/cumulative_proportions_nn_rfc.png" caption="" %}

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/reliability_curve_rfc_ft.png" caption="" %}

- Correlation Matrix

   With this method, we got a confirmation that our features selected from the feature engineering part are good. As mentioned before, none of them were highly correlated so we could keep them all.



#### IV. Best Neural Network model

We have come to the conclusion that the neural network trained with the optimized hyperparameters and the features selected by the random forest classifier had the best results overall. Indeed, it area under the ROC curve is nearly 1, the accuracy is high on new data and it had the best reliability curve of all.

### CONCLUSION:

For this part, we have attempted many different things to get the best model possible. We tried different types of models, different feature selection methods, shuffled the data and tuned the hyperparameters of our models. We have come to the conclusion that the best model was the best neural network model. When comparing all the different metrics from model to model, we can see that the best neural network had the best reliability curve even though the accuracy and ROC curve was slightly less good than the decision trees. Furthermore, it is the model we spent the most time tuning the hyperparamters and optimizing it as much as possible by trying different structures, optimizers, etc, therefore we felt the most confident with this model.


## 7. Evaluate on the test sets

Our models were trained on the NHL data from the 2015-2016 season to the 2018-2019 season and tested on the 2019-2020 season.

### Question 1: 

Here we present the confusion matrics for each of the 5 models on the 2019-2020 regular season dataset:
We can see that the 3 baseline models performs the worst and XGBoost seems to have the best performance. The Neural Network has a lot more false positives than XGBoost.

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/metrics_lr1_rs.png" caption="Confusion matrix for 1st logistic regression model" %}
{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/metrics_lr2_rs.png" caption="Confusion matrix for 2nd logistic regression model" %}
{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/metrics_lr3_rs.png" caption="Confusion matrix for 3rd logistic regression model" %}
{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/metrics_xbg_rs.png" caption="Confusion matrix for XGBoost model" %}
{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/metrics_nn_rs.png" caption="Confusion matrix for Neural Network" %}

For regular season data, we have 4 plots to compare the performances of the 5 models: 3 logistic regression models, 1 XGBoost model and 1 neural network model. We can see that there is a significant difference between the performance of the baseline models (logistic regressions) which were trained on a small set of features, and the models trained on a bigger and more advanced set of features (XGBoost and the neural network).

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/ROC_test_reg_season.png" caption="" %}

Note: here, the curves of the “LRDistance” and “LRDistance_ShootingAngle” logistic regressions overlap.

The XGBoost and the neural network have much better performances. Indeed, their area under the ROC curve is 1 which means these models have an ideal measure of separability. On the other hand, the logistic regression models are in the worst situation with an area of either 0.5 or 0.7. These models have no discrimination capacities to distinguish between the positive class and the negative class.

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/goal_rate_percentile_test_reg_season.png" caption="" %}

For the advanced models, the goal rates start high at the beginning of the x-axis (higher percentiles) then rapidly decrease, followed by a slower decrease. We can interpret this as the model being overconfident in predicting goals for shots with very high probabilities. The rapid decrease might signal a calibration issue. On the other hand, the logistic regressions have a steady decrease which can explain a moderate confidence in high probability shots.

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/cumulative_proportions_test_reg_season.png" caption="" %}

For the advanced models, there is a steep initial increase in the cumulative proportion of goals which indicates that the models are successful at identifying high-probability shots that are more likely to result in goals. The flatness of the curve afterwards suggests that as we move towards lower percentiles, it may suggest diminishing returns in terms of goal prediction as the model encounters shots with lower predicted probabilities. On the other hand, we see a consistent increase in their curves which shows a consistent predictive power.

We can see that the reliability curve for the neural network is under the reference line, this means it is over-predicting the true probability. Same for the logistic regression models. The XGBoost reliability curve, however, is all over the place which suggests that its predicted probabilities are not calibrated properly. This erratic behavior implies inconsistency in the model’s calibration.

Overall, our models had similar performance results as during their training. For some metrics, the results were better on the test set (ROC for the advanced models) and for other metrics (reliability curve) the results were less good (neural network and xgboost), but none of the models had surprisingly better or worse results than during their training.


### Question 2: 

Here we present the confusion matrics for each of the 5 models on the 2019-2020 playoffs dataset:

From the confusion matrics, we could see that the logistic regression model is performing a bit better on the playoff dataset than the regular season dataset. XGBoost is still performing the best out of all 5 models, and The Neural Network is still having higher false positive rate than XGBoost.

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/metrics_nn_pl.png" caption="Confusion matrix for Neural Network" %}

For playoffs season data, we have again 4 plots to compare the performances of the 5 models: 3 logistic regression models, 1 XGBoost model and 1 neural network model.

The observations are similar to the ones for the regular season test set.

We can observe a rising trend for the logistic regression models which might indicate that the models aren't effectively differentiating between high and low probability shots.

The observations are similar to the ones for the regular season test set.

{% include image_full.html imageurl="/images/milestone2/reliability_curve_test_playoffs.png" caption="" %}

Here we can see that the baseline models still underperform and need a lot of model calibration. The neural network's curve isn't much different either, it still seems to over-predict the true probability. However, the curve for the XGBoost model seems much better and closer to the reference line than any model (better than its curve for the regular season test set).


To summarize, we can see that there are slight differences in these figures compared to the regular season test set. We can notice that overall, the models performed less well on the playoff dataset as the plots indicate. Indeed, we got worse areas under the ROC curve although a slightly better reliability curve for all models involved. The Goal rate percentile graph and the cumulative proportions graph were very similar to the previous ones for the regular season test set.


This is to be expected since the dataset for the playoffs is much smaller than the dataset for the regular season therefore, one error has much more of an impact on the performance results than one error in the previous dataset. But overall, the results are satisfying because they are pretty similar which shows that the models didn't overfit or underfit and are capable of well generalizing.
